    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "As a result of the pandemic, many essential services including schools have been affected. With the uncertainty of the virus, many parents are worried about the safety of their children returning to in-person classes. Because of this, the school board has designed a new back-to-school plan that includes new safety measures and rules for allowing in-person classes.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restricted Application Scenario (Assumptions):\n",
    "- 7 class k's within the school (only 7 classes in the entire school that can use 10 rooms)\n",
    "- All classes will be in-person, 5 days a week (Mon-Fri) <br>\n",
    "- Only considering students and teachers <br>\n",
    "- School environment (total of 10 rooms) <br>\n",
    " - 7 classrooms (rooms 1-7)<br>\n",
    " - 1 cafeteria (room 8)<br>\n",
    " - 1 gym (room 9)<br>\n",
    " - 1 library room(10)<br>\n",
    " - Classrooms are disinfected after the end of every school day <br>\n",
    "- Each class must transition 7 times a day\n",
    "- Masks must be worn by every student and teacher <br>\n",

    "- Each class must transition 7 times a day (= 7)  <br>\n",
    "- Each room must visit the cafeteria once a day (= 1) <br>\n",
    "- Each room can only hold 1 class at a time (= 1) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals (Requested by the School Board):\n",
    "- Daily exposure score (Daily sum of Room Risk Exposure score per class + Daily sum product of Average Transition Time*Transition Risk Exposure score) per class should be less than or equal to 300 <br>\n",
    "- Daily summation of room risk exposure score per class should be less than or equal to 25 <br>\n",
    "- Daily summation of average transition time per class should be less than or equal to 40 <br>\n",
    "- Daily sum of transition risk exposure score per class should be less than or equal to 25 <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Penalty Weightings (Created by the School Board): <br>\n",
    "Weighting of 3:<br>\n",
    "- Going over the daily class exposure score per 1 point over <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighting of 2:<br>\n",
    "- Going over the daily class k room risk exposure score per 1 point over <br>\n",
