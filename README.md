cd '<PATH_YOU_WANT_REPO>'.

3) Clone the repository. Navigate to the repository and click the Green Code button. Copy the HTTPS link and run the following command:
'git clone <HTTPS_LINK>'.


#### Steps to run the model

1) open the file <MSCI332ClassroomSchedulingModel.ipynb> in Jupyter Notebook.

2) In **Step 4: Define the parameters**, use the preexisting objective function constants OR uncomment the block under to generate random integers between 1 and 5.
 
3) Click **Kernel** in the menu bar, then click **Restart and Run All** to run the entire program once.

4) The model should run and output a solution (if feasible) as well as a frequency graph in **step 9: ...**.

5) Results of the running model will be saved in both .csv and .lp files located in the **TestResults** folder (sorted by date-time) in the repository.
